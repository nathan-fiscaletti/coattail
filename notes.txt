To Do:

  Coattail Version Verification
  Batched Publications
  FIFO Actions?

  Cascade delete for Peer, Token, etc.
  Delete subscripton on failed auth during notify
  fix tables when output is plain or json
  Rate limitting
  per peer notifications
  move colors to class or consts
  key rotation
  service stop command based on pwd
  non-headless coattail instances in service status don't show instance path
  transmit log messages when remotely executing an action
  What happens if subscriber is down? Will it hold up other publications?

Other Project Ideas:

  File sync utility
  Data streaming from scratch
  Pick one encryption standard and implement it from scratch
