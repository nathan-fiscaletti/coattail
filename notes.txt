1. Make sure to avoid chained subscriptions. If X subscribes to both Y and Z and Y is subscribted to Z, when Z makes a purchase Y should make a purchase and X should make a purchase, but Y making that purchase shouldn't cause X to make two purchases (one for Y and one for Z).

2. When sharing subscription codes, they should be generated (or include auth) so that only those you want to can subscribe.

3. Be able to allocate fund limits to particular subscriptions.

4. Be able to configure scaled purchases and limits for subscriptions.
